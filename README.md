# Test DApp Solidity

This repository contains a **Simple Decentralized Application (DApp)** built for learning purposes. The project demonstrates the foundational concepts of Ethereum smart contracts, Solidity language, and the integration of blockchain with a frontend interface.

---

## Features

- Smart contract written in Solidity.
- Frontend interface built with JavaScript.
- Interacts with the Ethereum blockchain for decentralized functionality.
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation for learning purposes.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (latest stable version)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for managing dependencies)
- **MetaMask** (or any Web3-compatible wallet extension)
- **Ganache** (or any local Ethereum blockchain for testing)

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tanzimsafin/Test_Dapp_Solidity.git
   cd Test_Dapp_Solidity
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run a local Ethereum blockchain** (e.g., using Ganache).

4. **Deploy the smart contract**:
   Update the `truffle-config.js` or deployment script with your local blockchain configuration, then deploy the smart contract using:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

5. **Start the frontend**:
   Launch the frontend interface using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and connect your MetaMask wallet to the local Ethereum network.

---

## Project Structure

- **`contracts/`**: Contains the Solidity smart contracts.
- **`src/`**: Frontend application built with JavaScript.
- **`migrations/`**: Deployment scripts for the smart contracts.
- **`test/`**: Test cases for the smart contracts (optional).

---

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: For writing the smart contracts.
- **Truffle**: Development framework for Ethereum.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain for testing.
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet for connecting to the blockchain.
- **JavaScript**: For building the frontend interface.

---

## How It Works

1. The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. The frontend interacts with the smart contract using Web3.js.
3. Users can perform decentralized operations via the frontend interface, such as reading and writing data to the blockchain.
